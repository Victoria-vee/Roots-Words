**Roots & Words** is a website created with the aim of teaching Nigerian languagues to people from different cultural backgrounds across the world. With the concept of "japa" many Nigerians are left with no knowledge of their cultural backgrounds this website would help to bridge that divide and spread the Nigerian heritage far and wide.
